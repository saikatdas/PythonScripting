Regular expressions are used to find patterns in text. That's it. The pattern might be something as simple as the word "dog" in this sentence:

Test Regex here: https://regex101.com/

Text - The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Pattern- dog (Find dog in a sentence) 

Find all words in a sentence that contains the letter "o"

Pattern - \w*o\w*  (so \w means all letters between a-z and * means the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s.)

pattern: cat
string:  The cat was cut when it ran under the car.
matches:     ---

pattern: ca[rt]
string:  The cat was cut when it ran under the car.
             ---                               ----
Above will look for car and cat because rt is inside [] third bracket

String: ...match this regex `\[\]` with a regex?

Pattern: \\[rtn] or \\r|\\t|\\n
String: `\r`, `\t`, and `\n` are all regex escape sequences.

Pattern: \\.

Character ranges work the way you might expect, given the example above.
Put the first and last letters you want to match in the square brackets, with a hyphen in between them. If you only want to match the letters a through m, for instance, you could do:
pattern: \\[a-m]
string:  `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and `\f` are whitespace characters, `\.`, `\\` and `\[` are not.
matches:

Hexadecimal numbers can contain digits 0-9 as well as letters A-F.
When used to specify colours, "hex" codes can be as short as three characters.
Create a regex to find valid hex codes in the list below:

Pattern: [A-F0-9]{3}|[0-9]{3} or try this- [0-9A-F][0-9A-F][0-9A-F]
String :  1H8 4E2 8FF 0P1 T8B 776 42B G12

Using character ranges, create a regex that will select only the
lowercase consonants (non-vowel characters, including y)
in the sentence below:

pattern:  [b-df-hj-np-tv-z] or [^aeiou]
string:  The walls in the mall are totally, totally tall.

pattern: [^aeiou .,T]
string:  The walls in the mall are totally, totally tall.

Write a regex to match all characters below that aren't a literal carat ^ character:

pattern: [^\\^] or [^^]
string:  abc1^23*()

class	characters
\d	"digits" [0-9]
\w	"word characters" [A-Za-z0-9_]
\s	"whitespace" [ \t\r\n\f]
